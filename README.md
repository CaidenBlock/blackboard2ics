# Blackboard

A hacked together Python project for managing and syncing a better Blackboard calendar.

## Features

- OAuth support via selenium, since Blackboard does not have a user API
- Pushes to a gist, for syncing across
- Output calendar can be easily customized, to see what options are available check [the ical docs](https://allenporter.github.io/ical/ical/event.html)
